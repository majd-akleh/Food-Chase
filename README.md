# Food-Chase
Food Chase Game Simulation using Genetic Algorithm and Neural Networks.

Description:
This project simulate a food chase game, using java GUI board as N x N Grid.
Chaser and food element are located randomly on the board each round, the chaser tries to find the food as many times 
as possible, it uses a well trained NN to take decisions about the directions it is about to make.
The weights of the NN are generated using a GA approach. where every time we evaluate the NN by running the game
and see how many times the chaser eats food.

GA Chromosome: represents a list of all weights of the generated NN.

developers are: Majd Akleh, Marcel Zakour
